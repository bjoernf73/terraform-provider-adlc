## GPRegistryPolicyParser

An adapted copy of Microsoft's **GPRegistryPolicyParser** is embedded at
[`internal/ad/scripts/gpregistrypolicyparser.ps1`](internal/ad/scripts/gpregistrypolicyparser.ps1)
and used by the `adlc_json_gpo` resource and the `adlc_json_gpo_export` data source to read and
write Group Policy `Registry.pol` files. It has been adapted to run as an embedded script (see
the header comment in that file for the specific modifications); the parsing logic is unchanged.
