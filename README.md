# terraform-provider-adlc

A Terraform **Active Directory Lifecycle** provider that manages Active Directory
objects and policy through **PowerShell 7** on a remote Windows host over **WinRM**
or **SSH**.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an **experimental** provider.  Use it with care and expect breaking changes.

`docs/` is generated — edit the schema `MarkdownDescription` strings, the snippets in
[examples/](examples/), or the page templates in [templates/](templates/), then run:


```sh
make docs
```

## Quick start

A minimal configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    adlc = {
      source  = "bjoernf73/adlc"
      version = "0.0.30"
    }
  }
}

provider "adlc" {
  transport       = "winrm"
  host            = "dc1.contoso.local"
  username        = "CONTOSO\\terraform"
  password        = var.password
  winrm_auth      = "ntlm"
  powershell_path = "pwsh"
}

resource "adlc_organizational_unit" "servers" {
  path        = "Contoso/Servers/Windows"
  description = "Windows server OU"
}

resource "adlc_group" "server_admins" {
  name  = "Server Admins"
  path  = "Contoso/Groups"
  scope = "DomainLocal"
}

resource "adlc_access_rule" "delegate_computers" {
  target                = adlc_organizational_unit.servers.distinguished_name
  trustee               = adlc_group.server_admins.sid
  rights                = ["CreateChild", "DeleteChild"]
  object_type           = "computer"
  inherited_object_type = "organizationalUnit"
  inheritance           = "Descendents"
}
```

## Requirements

- PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) on the target host
- The `ActiveDirectory` and `GroupPolicy` PowerShell modules on the target host
- WinRM or OpenSSH reachable from wherever Terraform runs

## Transports

This provider is tested on gitlab runners running in a kubernetes cluster and virtual windows core and linux boxes. Mac and freebsd probably works, but that is untested.

| Transport | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| `winrm` | `basic`, `ntlm`, `kerberos` |
| `ssh` | password, private key |

Notes that save time:

- Don't spend time trying to get WinRM over http work when terraform runner is outside of domain, it is faster to configure https on 5986 using a self-signed certificate - it is done in minutes. 

- `kerberos` of course needs the target FQDN, not an IP address, because the SPN is derived from
  the host name. There are other requirements as well.

## Development

```sh
make build       # go build ./...
make vet
make test
make docs        # regenerate docs/ (needs the terraform CLI)
```

End-to-end tests live in [test/e2e/](test/e2e/) and run against a real domain controller
from CI over both transports. See [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml).

A manual transport check, for when CI is too slow a feedback loop:

```sh
ADLC_HOST=10.0.13.6 ADLC_USERNAME='CONTOSO\Administrator' ADLC_PASSWORD=... \
  go test ./internal/transport -run TestWinRMSmoke -v
```

## Releasing

### Building releases

Releases are **automatically built** via GitHub Actions when you push a tag to the `github` remote:

```sh
# Create and push a new version
git tag -s v0.0.30
git push github v0.0.30       # Triggers GitHub Actions build and release 
```

The GitHub Actions workflow ([.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)):
- Builds binaries for **linux_amd64**, **darwin_amd64**, **darwin_arm64**, **windows_amd64** ++
- Creates ZIP archives with proper Terraform naming (`terraform-provider-adlc_0.0.15_linux_amd64.zip`)
- Generates SHA256 checksums
- Creates a GitHub release with all artifacts
